# Algorithmic Transparancy Summary of Group Outputs

Written up notes from day 1 are available: Algorithmic Transparency Day 1 Notes.pdf Algorithmic Transparency Day 1 Notes.docx. These extent the flip chart notes in "day 1 flip chart photos".

Activity on day 2 combined a work-up of some ideas from the day 1 discussion with some cross-over with the Data Literacy Playground notes:
- proof of concept of an [xml language for algorithm description, "ATML"](algorithmic_transparency.xml) which could be used along side PMML, and for which Daniel Biedermann wrote a demonstrator web interface. [See Niall Scalter's web site](http://sclater.com/algorithmic_transparency/). Adam Cooper demonstated some examples of detail which could easily be auto-generated by the Tribal Student Insight data pipeline to populate ATML/PMML, including additional detail some stakeholders might want, based on runtime system configuration. (to do - add examples to repo)
- preparation of some proof of concept Jupyter notebooks to make predictive models more transparent - see Classifier Transparency directory/folder. These might be relevant to a data literacy playground as experiential learning tools.
